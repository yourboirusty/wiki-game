# wiki-game

Old project I dug up while skimming through my backups.

Simple chrome extension game that puts you on a random wikipedia page and measures time and jumps it took you to get to article about Adolf Hitler.
Disables navigation and detects if navbar was used during the run, invalidating it.
It was made to test the theory that you could get to Hitler from any article using three jumps on average.
